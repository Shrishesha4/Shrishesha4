description: Use the ReUI registry from your AI agent - find, install, and correctly use ReUI components (the 17 free building blocks like data-grid, kanban, filters), their free examples, premium blocks, and Motion Icons. Applies in any project using ReUI, the @reui registry, REUI_LICENSE_KEY, or any shadcn project where the user asks for premium blocks, data grids, kanban boards, dashboards, or full pages. Pairs with the free ReUI MCP server for live, scored registry search and inline component APIs.

> **ReUI skill version `42d70dcc3d`.** If the ReUI MCP's `get_agent_skill` reports a newer `version`, re-run the ReUI installer (see `get_agent_skill` -> `install.recommended`) to update this skill. Cloud/tools-only agents have no local file and always read the latest - they can ignore this.

# ReUI for Agents

ReUI is a shadcn-compatible registry. It ships four things you **reuse** - never redesign:

- **components** - the 17 ReUI building blocks with real APIs: `data-grid`, `kanban`, `filters`, `date-selector`, `tree`, `stepper`, ... (free)
- **examples** - free `c-*` single-pattern use-cases of a component (`c-kanban-1`); install one and read it to see exact composition
- **blocks** - premium full-page sections that compose components (`data-grid-2`, `pricing-page-1`); Pro or Ultimate license at install
- **icons** - Motion Icons in 4 styles, static + hover-animated variants; Ultimate license at install

The skill is free and this MCP is free to use; it just needs a ReUI account. On first use your agent opens a browser "Sign in with ReUI" prompt (a free account is created if you don't have one). Free covers components and examples with a daily request allowance; a Pro or Ultimate license unlocks premium blocks and Motion Icons and removes the limit (see [rules/registry.md](./rules/registry.md)). The same account and skill work in every agent and service the MCP connects to - this skill is agent-agnostic.

Skill + MCP are a team: this skill is the workflow (how to find, install, read the API, and adapt by reuse); the MCP is the live data and the hands (search, get_component, install commands). Your job: find the right item, install it with the shadcn CLI, read its real API, and **adapt by reuse** - wire real data and theme it; do not hand-roll or restyle what ReUI already provides. This skill **layers on the shadcn skill**: follow that for generic rules (spacing, `cn()`, semantic colors, forms); follow this for everything ReUI-specific.

## The core loop (MCP-native)

1. **Find** - call the ReUI MCP `search` tool with the user's intent. It returns a ranked, scored list across components/examples/blocks/icons, each with an `install` command, `previewUrl`, `docsUrl`, and `componentsUsed`. Pass hints (`type`, `component`, `category`, `features`, `free`) when you can infer them.
2. **Install** - run the returned command non-interactively (`npx shadcn@latest add @reui/<name> --yes`). The CLI resolves deps, aliases, and the base/style from `components.json`. See [cli.md](./rules/cli.md).
3. **Read the API (on your base)** - first note your base from `components.json` -> `style` (`base-nova` -> Base UI, `radix-nova` -> Radix UI). For each component an item uses, call `get_component(name)` and read its **inline `api`** (no web fetch); then `get_examples(name)` to install a worked example and copy its composition - the installed files are already in your base. Whenever you work with a component's API, also **share its `docsUrl`** (the primitive's API documentation page) with the user so they have the full reference. See [components.md](./rules/components.md).
4. **Adapt (reuse-first)** - swap demo data for real data, fix icon imports, align tokens. Do not redesign. See [adapting.md](./rules/adapting.md).

**Always show the preview.** Every item a tool returns carries a `previewUrl` (a live preview page). Whenever you list, recommend, or present ReUI items to the user - blocks, components, examples, or icons, whether from `search`, `search_icons`, `list_components`, `compose_page`, or any getter - include each item's `previewUrl` so they can SEE it before installing. Blocks and examples open an individual live preview; icons and components link to their live category/component page. Never present an item without its preview link.

If the ReUI MCP is not configured, fall back to `npx shadcn@latest search @reui -q "..."` then `add` - but the MCP gives scored matches + inline APIs; prefer it.

## Commands

Run ReUI as explicit slash commands (via the ReUI MCP) **or** just ask in plain language - both run the same workflow.

| Command     | Invoke                         | Does                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **build**   | `/mcp__reui__build <what>`     | Compose a page/section/feature from ReUI: plan → install → read API → adapt → craft → audit.                       |
| **add**     | `/mcp__reui__add <item>`       | Find & install one component/example/block/icon and wire it in.                                                    |
| **fix**     | `/mcp__reui__fix [target]`     | Diagnose & fix ReUI usage: wrong/undocumented props, base/radix mismatch, missing states, a11y/scroll.             |
| **improve** | `/mcp__reui__improve [target]` | Refine + extend existing ReUI UI to a production-exceptional bar (hierarchy, density, states, responsive, motion). |

Invocation differs slightly per agent (`/mcp__reui__build` in Claude Code/Cursor/Windsurf, `/mcp.reui.build` in VS Code). No command surface? Just describe what you want - this skill drives the identical loop.

## When to reach for ReUI vs plain shadcn

| Need                                                                 | Reach for                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A full page or section (dashboard, billing, auth, pricing, settings) | `compose_page` first (plans sections + best blocks), then ReUI **blocks** |
| A data table with sorting/filtering/pagination/virtualization        | the **data-grid** component (never hand-roll a `<table>`)                 |
| A drag-and-drop board                                                | the **kanban** component                                                  |
| Advanced column filtering, date range, tree, stepper, ...            | the matching ReUI **component**                                           |
| A single generic control already in shadcn (Button, Dialog, Select)  | plain **shadcn**                                                          |
